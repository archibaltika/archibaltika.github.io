                    Incredible animation, a massive roster of characters 
                    to care about, and the whole thing feels like playing 
                    an immense immersive RPG with your guild.

                    The action in this show is a big draw, 
                    but the real pull is how it depicts the 
                    way its characters react in the circumstances.

            <p>This anime series features a virtual reality massively 
                multiplayer online role-playing game, which shares its 
                name with the show's title (abbreviated SAO), that is 
                released in 2022. The game allows people to control their 
                in-game characters with their minds when using a Nerve Gear helmet. 
                One day, upon logging into SAO, the players discover they cannot log 
                out and learn from the game's creator that they must defeat the final boss. 
                If a player's avatar dies in the game, though, their body also dies in the 
                real world. One player, Kirito, sets out to beat the game on his own, 
                progressing through the game over two years, during which time he befriends 
                a female player, Asuna, with whom he falls in love. The duo eventually confronts 
                the in-game avatar of SAO's creator, hoping to free themselves and other players 
                from the game. Over time, Kirito realizes that the situation is a conspiracy that 
                runs deeper than just SAO and has penetrated other games.</p>
