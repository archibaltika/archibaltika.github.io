                    In our current age of terrifying dystopian realities,
                    it's hard to find a dystopian show with something new to
                    deliver - and yet here it is.

                    The animation is spellbinding... 
                    It's all wonderfully acrobatic and intense.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's a bleak and hopeless outlook, 
                    but one that makes for addictive viewing.

            <p>When man-eating Titans first appeared 100 years ago, 
                humans found safety behind massive walls that stopped the 
                giants in their tracks. But the safety they have had for so long 
                is threatened when a colossal Titan smashes through the barriers, 
                causing a flood of the giants into what had been the humans' safe zone. 
                During the carnage that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures 
                devour his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He enlists 
                some friends who survived to help him, and that group is humanity's last hope for 
                avoiding extinction at the hands of the monsters.
